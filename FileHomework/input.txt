 The difference among BufferedWriter, FileWriter and FileOutPutStream??
 FileWriter is used for writing streams of characters.
 
 BufferedWriter is almost similar to FileWriter 
 but it uses internal buffer to write data into File.
 
 Additionally, FileOutPutStream is used for writing streams of raw bytes.
